# GroceHaul
This is a web app that allows you to create and easily sort a grocery list for your weekly GroceHaul.

PROBLEM:
I recreate my grocery list every week. This is mainly because I like to check things off and delete them as I buy in the store. But this is super repetitive since I buy basically the same things every week.

SOLUTION:
I want to create a web app that makes it easy to setup a new list, populate with ingredients and items, and check them off as I go.

I want to have sections for -

Staples
Recipes
Random

FUTURE:
It would be really cool if I could push a button and pull in outside recipe data at random to add to my list. Items could be chosen to add or remove or the button can be pushed to bring up a new recipe entirely. API?

It would also be cool to be able to sort the final list by department/location in a store. This would have to be generalized to apply to different supermarkets/grocers. Something like:
Produce
Meat/Seafood
Canned
Condiments

*Add to this
